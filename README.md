# WOOF- The social network for dogs

The Woof mobile app was developed by students as final project of the web
development course of <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/de" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>.


## How to use WOOF

You want to go with your dog for a walk, and you have to make the most out of it
- especially for your four legged best buddy. Searching for some accompaniment
for your buddy can cause a lot of pain - your friends are no dog owners, you
have a limited amount of time and talking to strangers in the park becomes
creepy sometimes: The Woof app will solve all these problems at ones.

## Features

With the Woof app the user can create a *user profile* and afterwards a *dogs
profile* for his best buddy. Dog owners are able to choose their favorite *dog
park* and then they can see all the other dogs around that area, which are
*ready to walk* too. Since all of them are ready to go and everyone looks for
society - the user chooses his favorite profile.

The main feature of the app is the chat - that makes it possible to organize a
play date, stay in contact or just share information. The use of the chatroom
depends on a match: For that the user *sniffs* after choosing another dogs
profile and the sniffed one *sniffs* back. Ones a match is confirmed the user
can come back and talk to the other dog owner - because you’ll have an overview
with all your chats.

Beside all that the user can look on the *Discover page* randomly for any dog
whose owner is using the app. At this point it seems like some kind of *dog
tinder*: You see a profile - if you like it - *sniff* it! If you don't - *bark*
and you get another profile. And like before, if the other one sniffs you back,
there will be a chatroom available to talk to each other.

After all - users can choose their park and see how many other dogs are
available there.


## Project status 

The application is currently online and all the features above are working - but
it is still work in progress. There are more features planned - like creating a
dogs park and so on.
